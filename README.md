# search_and_sort_algorithms


      This repo is for illustrating sorting and searching algorithms.

The sorting problem is to rearrange a set of items in ascending order. One reason that it is so useful is that it is much               easier to search for something in a sorted list than an unsorted one. We will consider in detail some classical algorithms for sorting and searching, along with several applications where their efficiency plays a critical role.
